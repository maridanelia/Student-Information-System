**Instructions to run the application:

*Unix:
chmod +x activator
./activator run

*Windows:
activator run

The application now will be accessible on http://localhost:9000/.

For now, whenever you start the server you'll have to click "apply script now" on the app page. (Still figuring out how to do it automatically.)

There are three types of users for this app: student, teacher and administrator. Sample accounts for each of them are as follows:
	o	teacher@mail.com	
	o	student@mail.com
	o	admin@mail.com
Password for all sample accounts is "password"
